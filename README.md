# Image Encryption and Decryption

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a simple and efficient way to encrypt and decrypt images using Python and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The encryption process secures the image, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key, while the decryption restores the original image.

## ✨ Features
- Encrypts images using a secure algorithm
- Decrypts encrypted images back to their original form
- Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter
- Easy-to-use buttons for browsing, encryption, decryption, resetting, and exiting

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Tkinter (GUI)
- PIL (Pillow)

## 🚀 Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Vicky-sparrow/Image-Encryption-And-Decryption.git
   cd Image-Encryption-And-Decryption
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🔧 Usage
### Run the GUI Application
Execute the following command to launch the GUI application:
```sh
python app.py
```

### Encrypt an Image
1. Click on **Browse Image** to select an image.
2. The image will be displayed in the GUI.
3. The encryption key and encrypted image will be saved automatically.

### Decrypt an Image
1. Click on **Decrypt** to restore the original image.
2. The decrypted image will be displayed in the GUI.

### Save an Image
Click on **Save Image** to store the processed image at the desired location.

### Reset and Exit
- **Reset**: Clears the GUI for a new operation.
- **Exit**: Closes the application.
